In this project I'm going to use a led RGB of 5 mm (with incorporated resistances) with Matlab. The idea is to turn on the light and change the color of the led. 

The materials used are the following ones:

Arduino UNO R3.
Matlab.
led RGB 5mm
Cables

To take in account:

We build a program to control RGB LED color using Arduino Analog output (PWM).
Please be careful if you want to work with Arduino PWM
If you have Arduino UNO, you will see PWM label as DIGITAL (PWM ~). It means your PWM pins can be found on DIGITAL pins which pin with ~, for instance, ~3,~5,~6,~9, ~10, ~11.
