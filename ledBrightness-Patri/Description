We try to control LED brightness by controlling voltage on LED.
MATLAB for Arduino support provides writePWMVoltage() function to set voltage on PWM pins. 
We can set a voltage value from 0 to 5 for Arduino Uno.

Materials used: 
- Arduino UNO
- LED
- Protoboard
- Wires

More info: 
This program will set voltage value on PWM pin on digital pin 3 from 0 to 5 and then set a value from 5 to 0 too.
