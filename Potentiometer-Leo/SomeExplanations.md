**# CrystalBall_Leo**

Create a crystal ball to tell your Future

**General explanation:**

In this project we will simulate how a "crystal ball" works. The idea would be that people ask a question and then shake the crystal ball and it would give them an answer to that question. Similarly, the idea would be to use the tilt switch as a crystal ball and we would use the LCD (16x2), to show the answer.

LCD: (Liquid Cristal Display) 
The LCD can be used to display alphanumeric characters. In this case we use a 16 column, 2 row LCD. There are 16 pins in the LCD circuit.
