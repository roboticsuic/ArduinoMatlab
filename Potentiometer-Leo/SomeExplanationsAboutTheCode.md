**# Potemtiometer_Leo**

**General explanation:**
In this practice we will learn to read the analog input on the arduino board. To do this we will use a potentiometer as an analog input source.

Being the objective to learn how to read the analog input on the arduino board.

We will connect the VCC pin to the Arduino board on the VCC input (+5V), the Vout pin to the analog input A2 on the Arduino board and the GND pin to the GND input.
