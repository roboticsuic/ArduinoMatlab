**In this project** I'm going to do a demo of an Analog Output (PWM): RGB LED

Therefore, to do this, I'm going to use:
- Arduino UNO R3.
- Matlab code.
- LED RGB.
- Thinkercad. (to design the scheme).

**Tips**:
- PWM pins are marked in Arduino UNO with '~' in front of the pin number.
- RGB LED CATHOD: The longer pin is (-), also known as 'Common pin' and the other pins are (+).
  - Depending on the (+) pins used we are going to obtain a color or another.
