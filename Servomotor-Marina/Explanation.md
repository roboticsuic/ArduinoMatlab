In this project I'm going to use a servo motor with Matlab. The idea is to make it move from 0ยบ to 180ยบ and the other way round.

The materials used are the following ones:
- Arduino UNO R3.
- Matlab.
- Servo Motor.

**To take in account**:
- To use the servo motor in matlab we use the servo() function.
- In this code the 0-180 movement is done in 4 steps. If you want to reduce it or make it larger, just change the interval in the for: 
for more steps the 0.25 --> f.e.(0.10), for less steps, the 0.25 --> f.e.(0.5).
- Further explanations of the code can be found in the code file.
